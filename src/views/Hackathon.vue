				<h2>Design a
circular mini-village
for EU students 
in central Portugal</h2>									
				<p>
				The current school system is based on the linear 
economy, to prepare students for the circular economy 
a whole new way of teaching is required. One way of 
doing so is by studying and working in real-life living labs. 
So a property with 5 hectares of land has been purchased.

				</p>	
				<p>
					Living labs, as a serious playground, in which students, companies, institutes and governments can jointly work on finding solutions for complex circular challenges. How do we solve soil degradation, water management, social inclusion, finite resources, decreasing biodiversity, an aging population 
and brain drain to the cities, in short:
 how do we solve the big questions of today and tomorrow?
In our living lab we want to invite students from all over the EU to jointly
work on these big questions. We have set the stage, but
how should this serious playground in Portugal look like?<br/><br/>
Thatâ€™s the question that you are going to work on:<br/></br>
step 1 - get familiar with the concept<br/>
step 2 - what concrete things should be available and why<br/>
step 3 - what is most urgent and important<br/>
step 4 - Visualize in a poster and 3D model<br/>
